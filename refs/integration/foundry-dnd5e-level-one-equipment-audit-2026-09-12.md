# Foundry D&D5e Level 1 Equipment Mapping Audit

Date: 2026-09-12
Target: Foundry VTT `14.367` + D&D5e `6.0.0`
Character Forge adapter: `0.9.0`

## Purpose

Inventory every equipment `itemId` that the current D&D Level 1 generation paths can emit and separate Character Forge semantic IDs from pinned Foundry Item semantics before broadening export coverage.

This is an adapter audit, not a new canonical equipment model. Character Forge native D&D state remains authoritative.

## Implemented Coverage

Adapter `0.9.0` currently maps:

### Weapons

Initial proof:

- `greatsword`
- `flail`
- `javelin`

Simple-weapon breadth:

- `dagger`
- `quarterstaff`
- `spear`
- `shortbow`
- `handaxe`
- `mace`
- `sickle`

Remaining martial-weapon breadth:

- `scimitar`
- `shortsword`
- `longbow`
- `greataxe`
- `longsword`

All currently emitted weapon IDs now have pinned mappings.

All weapon mappings preserve deterministic embedded IDs, native quantity, pinned price/weight, base damage, weapon category/base item, properties, mastery, and range. Activities remain empty.

`shortbow` and `longbow` preserve the pinned static `ammunition.type = "arrow"` filter without inventing a relationship to an Arrows Item. Quarterstaff, spear, and longsword preserve the accepted bounded versatile marker shape without inventing alternate-damage automation.

### Armor and Shield Equipment

Implemented:

- `chain-mail`
- `chain-shirt`
- `shield`
- `leather-armor`
- `studded-leather-armor`

All armor/shield Items use the pinned target category/base-item and armor fields. Newly broadened armor remains unequipped; Actor AC remains flat and authoritative until calculation parity is separately proven.

### Consumables / Ammunition

Implemented:

- `arrow` -> Foundry identifier `arrows`, type `ammo`, subtype `arrow`, native quantity preserved.

Deferred:

- `healers-kit` - Foundry target is `consumable`, but its activity remains outside the equipment-data proof.

### Containers and Packs

All currently emitted mundane container IDs are implemented:

- `dungeoneers-pack`
- `explorers-pack`
- `quiver`
- `entertainers-pack`
- `priests-pack`
- `burglars-pack`
- `scholars-pack`
- `pouch`

Container mapping uses the live D&D5e 6.0 model shape. Pack contents are not inferred, and unsupported multi-container native stacks are deferred rather than silently collapsed.

### Direct Tool Concepts

Implemented:

- `calligraphers-supplies` -> Foundry `tool`, type `art`, base item `calligrapher`, ability `dex`
- `thieves-tools` -> Foundry `tool`, blank type value, base item `thief`, ability `dex`
- `herbalism-kit` -> Foundry `tool`, blank type value, base item `herb`, ability `int`

All three preserve exact pinned identifier, price, weight, native quantity, deterministic embedded IDs, and Character Forge source provenance. Descriptions and activities remain empty, and proficiency/container relationships are not inferred.

### Dynamic Tool and Instrument IDs

Character Forge can emit 17 artisan-tool variants and 10 musical-instrument variants through prefixed semantic IDs.

`artisan-tools:<tool-id>` may use:

- `alchemists-supplies`
- `brewers-supplies`
- `calligraphers-supplies`
- `carpenters-tools`
- `cartographers-tools`
- `cobblers-tools`
- `cooks-utensils`
- `glassblowers-tools`
- `jewelers-tools`
- `leatherworkers-tools`
- `masons-tools`
- `painters-supplies`
- `potters-tools`
- `smiths-tools`
- `tinkers-tools`
- `weavers-tools`
- `woodcarvers-tools`

`musical-instrument:<instrument-id>` may use:

- `bagpipes`
- `drum`
- `dulcimer`
- `flute`
- `horn`
- `lute`
- `lyre`
- `pan-flute`
- `shawm`
- `viol`

The Character Forge prefix carries semantic context and is not part of the Foundry identifier.

All 17 `artisan-tools:*` variants are implemented through an explicit whitelist. Their compound Character Forge source IDs remain intact for deterministic IDs and provenance while Foundry receives the exact pinned target identifier and static tool fields.

The 10 `musical-instrument:*` variants remain deferred and are the next bounded category.

### Compound Focus IDs

These require decomposition/translation and must not be passed through as Foundry identifiers:

- `druidic-focus:quarterstaff`
- `druidic-focus:sprig-of-mistletoe`
- `arcane-focus:crystal`
- `arcane-focus:orb`
- `arcane-focus:quarterstaff`

### Other Semantic Aliases Requiring Explicit Translation

- `gaming-set:dice`
- `book:prayers`
- `book:history`
- `book:occult-lore`
- `holy-symbol` - pinned Foundry 2024 data uses a target such as `holy-symbol-varies`; do not assume identifier equality.

### Simple Gear Still Requiring Exact Target Fixture Review

- `parchment-sheet`
- `robe`
- `crowbar`
- `travelers-clothes`
- `spellbook`

## Emitted Character Forge Equipment Space

The current Level 1 generator has 48 literal equipment IDs plus 27 possible dynamic prefixed tool/instrument IDs, for 75 possible distinct Character Forge equipment IDs.

The adapter intentionally treats these as Character Forge semantic IDs rather than assuming string equality with Foundry identifiers.

## Source Paths Audited

Character Forge:

- `packages/system-dnd5e/src/guidedFirstSlice.ts`
- `packages/system-dnd5e/src/guidedChoices.ts`
- `packages/system-dnd5e/src/firstSliceCharacter.ts`

Pinned Foundry D&D5e 6.0 schema/examples now include:

- `module/data/item/weapon.mjs`
- `module/data/item/equipment.mjs`
- `module/data/item/consumable.mjs`
- `module/data/item/container.mjs`

- `packs/_source/equipment24/weapons/martial-melee/greataxe.yml`
- `packs/_source/equipment24/weapons/martial-melee/longsword.yml`
- all 17 `packs/_source/equipment24/tools/artisan/*.yml` fixtures corresponding to the emitted artisan suffix set
- the pinned `packs/_source/equipment24/tools/other/musical-instrument/` directory, which contains all 10 emitted musical-instrument suffixes
- prior pinned armor, ammunition, container, and Fighter proof fixtures recorded in repository history.

## Recommended Next Slice

Translate only the 10 emitted `musical-instrument:<instrument-id>` variants.

1. inspect all 10 corresponding pinned Foundry D&D5e 6.0 musical-instrument fixtures;
2. map compound Character Forge source IDs through an explicit whitelist to the exact Foundry target identifiers;
3. preserve pinned static tool fields, native quantity, deterministic embedded IDs, and the original compound Character Forge source ID in provenance flags;
4. keep descriptions and activities empty and do not infer proficiency, equipped state, or container relationships;
5. prove all 10 mappings deterministically; and
6. keep focus aliases, gaming/book aliases, healer's-kit activity semantics, simple gear, feature/activity Items, spell Items, media packaging, Download UX, and runtime acceptance deferred.

This category follows the same semantic-prefix boundary now proven by the artisan-tool slice and has an exact 10-fixture target family in the pinned Foundry 6.0.x source tree.
